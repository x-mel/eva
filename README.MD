#What is madness?
Remember that last time you were trying to watch that episode of Game of thrones on a streaming website? 500 pop ads, and
lots of clicks to get to the actual video, and bummer, you can't even download it for free. Just sitting there waiting for it
to buffer, and praying nothing goes wrong. That's by no mean a way to watch Arya Stark beating the shit out of the Lannisters.  
Cry no more. God exists and he's here to save you from the devil's minions, those evil ads.  
You send us a link for the movie hosted by selected file hosting websites, and the server return a link to the video, that you
can use to directly download it, or stream it with your favorite video player. You don't even have to go the website.  
Just sit, chill, and enjoy!
